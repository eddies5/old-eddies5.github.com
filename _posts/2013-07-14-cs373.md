So remember that project I was talking about last week? It turned out to be a lot more work than I originally thought. -__- The project was due Thursday night at ten; it was nine and there were still many things to be done. Thankfully though, Downing gave everyone a one day extension. Having our website hosted somewhere was a pain. We were supposed to use a university server called z, but setting that up was an entire day event and not all features worked correctly on z. We also hosted on heroku, after a [small debugging session](/school/2013/07/14/heroku.html) all features were [available](http://immense-oasis-7538.herokuapp.com/). (Yes, it looks a lot like this site, iteration two will hopefully change that.) The database stuff was also a pain; the university doesn't give students permission to create databases on the MySql server. We ended up using sqlite3, which is pretty neat.

Being project leader was really fun. I learned how to distribute tasks; make incremental steps to move the project along, and how to interact with other developers as a leader. I hope my teammates have learned as much from me as I have from them. I like that I still coded as a leader; I don't see this practice much in the real world. I feel a manager (etc.) should always "keep his hand in the code" as a way to keep their skills fresh and to maintain the respect of their colleagues.

We have a test this upcoming Friday. I've heard many different things about Downing's exams. That you really have to study the examples from class, the cheat sheet doesn't help you, the multiple choice will get you, the programming section will be straightforward, \[insert other rumors here\]. I'll just focus on all of the python stuff we've been doing. I'll start studying now...
