It's finally over. Overall CS 373 Software Engineering with Glenn Downing is a must for every CS major. You will walk out knowing more than when you came in. It's quite a bit of work, but I believe my late nights in the CS lab were worth it. To succeed in this class you have to be curious enough about the material that you will actually study. Go to the interpreter and learn. Also, read the required readings.

Study the details of everything for his exams. I remember taking the exams and changing my answers to questions as I went back through the exam. Be prepared to do that; you will remember that one small detail that totally changes the answer to the question. I think this actually improved my exam scores. After both exams I walked out feeling unsure of the exam. It's hard to tell with his exams unless you really did know all of those small details.

Downing is cool. I can tell he's still eager to learn as well. He allowed us to use heroku for the first time in his class and I am so glad that he did. I don't think another professor would be as willing to adapt and let their students experiment with other technologies.

Oh, and watch out for those Downingisms like "just so." They're entertaining really. He also says "damn" quite a bit; I counted thirty-eight occurrences of "damn" (plus or minus ten because I was absent two days) this Summer. Pretty funny!
