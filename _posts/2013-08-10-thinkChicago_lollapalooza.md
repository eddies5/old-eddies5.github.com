It came to my surprise that I was accepted into a program called [ThinkChicago:Lollapalooza](http://thinkchicago.net). I traveled to Chicago to participate in a conference which contained a series of talks with entrepreneurial leaders, a pitch-off contest, and attendance to the Lollalpalooza music festival.

This was my first time in Chicago. It's a nice place. When people say Chicago they are actually talking about the massive downtown area. There are so many skyscrapers. The conference took us on an architectural boat tour of Chicago; I enjoyed that a lot.

Many interesting people talked to us throughout the three days of the conference. Neal Sales-Griffin was the MC and co-founder of the [The Starter League](http://www.starterleague.com/). As I was talking to him, it turns out one of his students was the one who started [The Maker Square](http://www.themakersquare.com/) here in Austin. (Small world!)

[Harper Reed](https://harperreed.com/) has been one of the best presenters I have ever heard! He had about 200 slides I believe, but he went through all of them (with time left for questions) in about thirty minutes. I was engaged the entire time he was talking. His speech was entitled, "How to Be Awesome." He started his presentation saying how he was going to be talking about his favorite subject, "himself." Hilarity aside, I noticed his talk didn't answer the original question: "how does one, 'be awesome?'" When his talk ended I had a realization: being awesome is not a cookie-cutter process that can be replicated across many individuals. Being awesome is defined by what _you_ want it to be; I consider being awesome as just being yourself.

[Brian Fitzpatrick](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101174951617223562800/about) and [Ben Collins-Sussman](https://plus.google.com/113939332173985992126/posts) (co-founder of Subversion) talked to us about "The Myth of the Genius Programmer." They noted how many developers wait to have their code open sourced because they don't want to give the impression that their code isn't perfect. They encouraged us to release early because "with many eyes all bugs are shallow;" essentially humble yourself as a programmer, learn to work well with others, and accept constructive criticism.

Desiree Vargas Wrigley spoke to us about social entrepreneurship, something I had never heard of. It's this idea about a "double bottom line," doing good for society while at the same time making profit. She co-founded a company called [GiveForward](http://www.giveforward.com) which crowd-funds for medical emergencies. [Eric Lunt](http://about.me/elunt) (CTO and co-founder of BrightTag) and Dag Kittlaus (creator of Siri) presented together. They had amazing stores to tell. I particularly enjoyed Dag's story about getting his first phone call from Steve Jobs. Afterwards, Francesca Slade (Software Engineer at Google) talked about her time at Google. You could immediately tell that she was very happy with her career at Google. She said she went to Google straight out of college and she considers herself spoiled by the company. She is also very active in the Chicago area helping technology education in schools and women developers in Chicago. I liked Zach Kaplan's (CEO of [Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/)) story: he didn't like that in college his Mechanical Engineering program didn't have enough hands on building projects, so he made a career of helping others build things. What a great example of taking matters in your own hands.

After all of the talks I went on a tour of the Microsoft office in Chicago; they had a lot of cool technology to show off. That night we had dinner and were then given the task to create an idea that would benefit Chicago, write a pitch, and create a poster. We had about one hour and a half to complete the task. The idea that my group came up with was a cloud based collaboration tool between students and teachers. Imagine pinterest plus trello. We were unfortunately not chosen as finalist. The following morning I watched as the three final groups presented in front of the mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, CTO of Chicago, John Tolva, co-founder of GrubHub, Matt Maloney, co-founder of [Power2Switch.com](https://power2switch.com/), Phil Nevels, and Commissioner of Chicago's Department of Innovation and Technology, Brenna Berman. An idea named "Pothole Patrol" won. They devised a system that would detect Chicago potholes and send work crews to fix them. After the pitch-off I got a tour of Groupon in Chicago. I really liked Groupon's work area; it looks like a fun place to be.

Then I went to Lollapalooza! Friday night I saw my favorite band of all time, The Killers! They are so good live! The second day of the festival we were given a backstage tour of Lollapalooza. As we were being led backstage I spotted [Haim](http://haimtheband.com/) (my first celebrity encounter)! We then heard a Q/A session with a few producers and one of the founders of Lollapalooza about how technology plays a role in Lollapalooza.

Overall this was an amazing experience. The highlight of my summer!
